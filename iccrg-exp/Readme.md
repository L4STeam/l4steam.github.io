This directory holds the results and scripts used to generate them (virtual network, metric collection, plotting)
that were presented during the ICCRG meeting held during IETF-109 on Nov. 20 2020.

The [testrunner.py] script is the one responsible to drive the whole experiment. E.g. `./python testrunner.py --help` for usage instructions.
The full set of results is spread over [results/](results) (raw data) and [results/plots](results/plots) (plots (sic)).
